# VMware PowerCLI

This repository includes some of my VMware PowerCLI scripts. Feel free to fork this repository.

A short description of the scripts in this repository.

Create-PortGroupsfromCSV.ps1
----------------------------
This script creates multiple port-groups on a VMware Standard Switch based on information in a CSV file.

Get-ScreenshotFromVM.ps1
------------------------
This script retrieves a console screenshot of one or more virtual machines.

Fix-iovDisableIRSetting.ps1
---------------------------
The script checks the current setting of the Intel IOMMU interrupt remapper (iovDisableIR) and fixes this issue if necessary. This is especially designed for customers that are running VMware ESX 5.5, 6.0 and 6.5 on HPE ProLiant Gen8 models
